Fix the database so it does not have page, measure, column with ANECDOTES.
Then, fix the get_books.php if necessary,
Then, the index.html to only display id, header, data, date
And the save_book.php and update_book.php to only use those columns.
Check that the selector works for the images.
Send the selected url ( which may have multiple images )
to a page to display the images with the title.
DONE - Also, fix so that only the 'logged_in' is used for the user, BUT
  use a 'page' cookie to remember the page.  they may not be logged
  in when they are viewing the pages.

Fix display of menu to be a drop down. AND, and consistent for index
and sorter.

DONE - Move index.html to editor.html.  Add index.html that redirects to
reader.php.
